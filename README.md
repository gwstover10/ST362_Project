**Description:**

Governments have been around almost since the beginning of humanity, and politics even before that. The way people live is dictated by the society and system they live in, and is extremely important to their way of life. Despite this, many are often suspicious of their government’s actions, with good reason. Numerous scandals and crimes have been exposed over centuries worldwide, each increasing distrust in their respective governments. What we wanted to see was if a government's distrust had anything to do with how free the people under said government are. Using the World Happiness Index from 2016, we produced a model to compare trust in government, using both the freedom and region of each nation.

**The Variables:**

Name: Name of the country

Region: Region the country belongs to

Happiness Rank: Rank of the country based on the Happiness Score

Happiness Score: A metric measured in 2016 by asking the sampled people the question: "How would you rate your happiness on a scale from 1 to 10?”

Economy (GDP per Capita): The extent to which GDP contributes to the calculation of the Happiness Score.

Family: The extent to which Family contributes to the calculation of the Happiness Score

Health (Life Expectancy): The extent to which Life expectancy contributed to the calculation of the Happiness Score

Freedom: The extent to which Freedom contributed to the calculation of the Happiness Score

Trust (Government Corruption): The extent to which Perception of Corruption contributes to Happiness Score

Generosity: The extent to which Generosity contributed to the calculation of the Happiness Score

**Changes:**

Outside of the model, the only change to the actual variables made was the Region variable. Before the change, there were 10 different regions from around the world, which were Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, Eastern Asia, Southeastern Asia, Southern Asia, Middle East and Northern Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, North America, Latin America and Caribbean, and Australia and New Zealand. However, we felt that these regions could be renamed and combined into larger subregions that would allow us to create one of the features for our model. The new regions, called Europe, Asia, Africa and Middle East, Americas, and Oceania, are combinations or renaming of prior regions:

Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe -> Europe

Eastern Asia, Southeastern Asia, Southern Asia -> Asia

Middle East and Northern Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa -> Africa and Middle East

North America, Latin America and Caribbean -> Americas

Australia and New Zealand -> Oceania
